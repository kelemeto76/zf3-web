# ZF2019-01: Information disclosure in zend-developer-tools

The package
[zendframework/zend-developer-tools](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-developer-tools)
provides a web-based toolbar for introspecting an application. When updating the
package to support PHP 7.3, a change was made that could potentially prevent
toolbar entries that are enabled by default from being disabled.

## Affected versions

- zendframework/zend-developer-tools 1.2.2

## Action Taken

A test was added to the package to verify that only whitelisted entries should
be aggregated when configuring the toolbar, and the code updated to comply.

The patch resolving the vulnerability is available in zend-developer-tools
1.2.3.

We highly recommend all users of the package to update immediately.

### Acknowledgments
