Since its inception, [Zend Technologies](https://www.zend.com), and later [Rogue
Wave Software](https://www.roguewave.com), has been single-handedly leading and
sponsoring the Zend Framework project. Over the years, Zend Framework has seen
wide adoption across the PHP ecosystem, with an emphasis on the Enterprise
market. It has formed the basis of numerous business application and services
including eCommerce platforms, content management, healthcare systems,
entertainment platforms and portals, messaging services, APIs, and many others.

> To take it to the next step of adoption and innovation, we are happy to
> announce that we are transitioning Zend Framework and all its subprojects to an open
> source project hosted at the [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org).  

The Linux Foundation is host to a range of widely successful open source
projects, and has led many similar transitions in the past. We believe that by
moving Zend Framework to this proven governance model, it will enjoy both growth
in adoption and contributors, and it will continue to focus on delivering best
of breed innovative code, using the highest standards of security, transparency,
and quality. 

Please welcome [The Laminas Project](https://getlaminas.org)!

> The transition is already underway, but that we are working to finalize the
> list of founding members. [Contact us to learn more about membership benefits
> and how your company can help guide the project
> roadmap.](https://getlaminas.org/about/join)
